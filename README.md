# MyYeeLight
The python program scrapes the forecast from BBC Weather and then creates a flow program to run on the YeeLight that will provide good lighting and compensate for the predicted lighting conditions throught the day and into the night.

Future features:
Pause feature - allow turn off and resume for when user must leave for a prolonged period
Use OpenWeather API (as suggested by a new friend)
